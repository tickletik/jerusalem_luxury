To reinstall everything (like in syncdb) use scripts/reset.sh

That's also a good place to find out how things get done

python libraries to install:

    PyYaml - for installing yaml files in loaddata:
        easy_install-2.5 pyyaml
    
    jinja2 - for the template engine:
        easy_install-2.5 Jinja2==dev 

    lxml - bindings for libxml and libxslt:
        easy_install-2.5 lxml



directory structure should be something like:

~/repository
~/apps
~/templates
~/media
~/path/to/python/django/libs
~/path/to/jerusalem_luxury


figure out a way to transfer one of the hash keys to whatever server you are using so you can update the git repository

the format is always:
push github master
pull github master

(NOTE:FIND THE ACTUCAL COMMANDS FROM GITHUB AND PUT THEM ALL HERE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH)
