make sure to install yaml on whatever system you are using so that you can sync

directory structure should be something like:

~/repository
~/apps
~/templates
~/media
~/path/to/python/django/libs
~/path/to/jerusalem_luxury


figure out a way to transfer one of the hash keys to whatever server you are using so you can update the git repository

the format is always:
push github master
pull github master

(NOTE:FIND THE ACTUCAL COMMANDS FROM GITHUB AND PUT THEM ALL HERE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH)
